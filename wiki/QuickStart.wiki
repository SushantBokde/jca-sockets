A socket is identified by a pair of addresses (IP + port). For example if I am connecting from 192.168.1.1 to 10.10.10.1 listening on port 9000, then may Socket will be 
{192.168.1.1:SOME_PORT, 10.10.10.1:9000}. The SOME_PORT is allocated dynamically by the client. These are sometimes called ephemeral ports.

When a client socket is closed it goes into a TIME_WAIT state. The local port before being able to be reused (a socket is identified by a pair of ports: the fixed listener port and the dynamically allocated client port).

If you are working on windows and opening and closing many connections, certain windows limits may cause problems.

=== Reducing TIME_WAIT ===
The length of the TIME_WAIT in seconds set by *adding* a DWORD to the registry {{{HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\TcpTimedWaitDelay}}} (default is 240 seconds, minimum is 30 seconds).

See [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc938217.aspx Microsoft Document on setting TcpTimedWaitDelay] for details.

=== Increasing available ports ===
Additionally you may run out of local sockets and you can increase these again by *adding* a DWORD to the registry {{{HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\MaxUserPort}}} (default is 5000, maximum is 65536).

See [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc938196.aspx Microsoft Document on setting MaxUserPort] for details.
